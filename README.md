# Quera-Project
I developed this project during the "Back-end development with Django" course in Quera. 
The site has two types of users: charity and benefactor.
Charities define tasks and benefators can ask to take over any task with the permission of the owner charity. Finally when a task is done, it is removed from the list of waiting tasks.
